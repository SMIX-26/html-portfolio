<h1>The Best Movies According To Samikshya</h1>
<h2>My Top 4 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jurrasic World</h3>

<p>This movie is always a charm to watch at any given time and pays tribute to the original Jurassic Park, for it's a solid 4.5 stars.
While often treading over familiar ground and reusing the same ideas, it's still wildly entertaining and still offered something fresh
and new, and boasts some of the best action and suspense of the trilogy. 
If you're looking for dinosaur mayhem that looks no further, this movie has it all. 
The special effects and CGI are very well done in this movie so the creatures look genuinely real. 
It's an absolute thrill ride all the way through with fun characters and lots of action. My only wish is that I could say the same thing about Fallen Kingdom. 
But overall this movie always has special place in the back of my head and remains an underrated classic and is the best sequel that we've received so far which gives me high hopes for Dominion.</p>

<h3>The Red Notice</h3>

<p>Red Notice is one of my favorite movies ... so well done, full of action, good plot, such funny sequences, and an amazing performance of the actors ...
The director of Rawson Marshall is doing an amazing job, a very good director who knows what he's doing!
The film starts with Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, Ritu Arya, Chris Diamantopoulos ...
Gal Gadot is a beautiful and talented actress, I can't believe how good she looks in this movie, Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson do an amazing job together, they are by far the best part of the movie ... Ritu Arya and Chris Diamantopoulos Although they don't play such an important role in the movie, they are very good at what they do, and you really don't feel they are stuffing, again very nice and good actors.
The story is one of my favorites, it's a fictional story about Cleopatra's three eggs. John Hartley, an "FBI agent" wants to catch the world's greatest art thief, Nolan Booth, with information from The Bishop/Sarah Black...as the story progresses it takes a bunch of twists.
I have to add that my favorite character is Nolan Booth, played by Ryan Reynolds ... he has his signature, I love him when he talks like a broken doll. I actually love every character he plays, he's a very good actor who doesn't feel like he's playing a role, he's himself
I would actually be up to seeing a sequel to be honest</p>

<h3>Cuttputli</h3>

<p>Cuttputlli has set the benchmark of fore coming thriller movies very high as this was so amazing. 
I wonder why Bollywood does not make more movies of this guy
Akshay Kumar playing the police role is something that has always excited me. 
And in cuttputlli too, he did so well. This movie is a pretty intense one and akshay pulled it off greatly. Loved watching</p>

<h3>Forensic</h3>

<p>The greatest serial killer film I've ever seen. I urge everyone to see this movie. 
Everything in this movie is fantastic, and I enjoyed it. You should all watch this. 
The plot is excellent, and the movie only focuses on the plot—no added romances—so if you like thriller and suspense movies,
this is the ideal movie for you people. Each character fully commits to their duties; there is no overacting. 
The movie was pretty good to me.</p>
